# Purpose of this Repo

A place for members of the Wood Chips & Bits slack channel to post evergreen content, project docs, and other topical bits of information.  Wood Chips & Bits is a slack community for those who pay the bills doing dev/design/systems/etc. and who have woodworking as a common interest.  If you build with bits and then build with wood, join us!

# Contributing

All members of the WC&B slack channel are welcome to submit PR's to this repo.  It is intended to evolve in structure, framework, style, etc., as members see fit, and moderation is limited only to keeping content (mostly) on topic.

This repo currently uses Hugo and Markdown, feel free to clone and `hugo new posts/your-awesome-project` and toss up some content!
